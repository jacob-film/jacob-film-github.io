Course:

Automous Field Robotics

Description:

This course thoroughly reinforced a foundational knowledge of optimization techniques, probabalistic 
state estimation & error propogation, and advanced spatial geometry (epipolar / projective), off of which
was built a broad exposure to modern perception techniques, mapping algorithms, and general autonomy 
as relates to the field of robotic navigation.

My work during the semester consisted of several individual topical projects and 2 research-based presentations.
These included classic tasks such as markov state-transition modeling, homography-based image stitching and trajectory
extraction, optimized construction of structural point-clouds from motion-series images (SfM), and KALMAN filter implementation
for multi-sensor data.

My research presentations were on ORB-SLAM and Occupancy Grids / Path Planning.

My Takeaways:

Reinforced ability to conceptualize and model information in a probabalistic framework

Significantly deeper understanding of algorithmic optimization
(Gradient Descent, RANSAC, Bundle Adjustment, Factor Graphs usage, etc..)

Course:

Robotic Sensing & Navigation

Description:

This course served as a hands-on project-based survey of the hardware, software,
probabalistic models, and algorithmic techniques commonly used for sensing and navigation
in modern robotics.

Through the use of cameras, GPS (GNSS) devices, IMUs, and lasers, I learned the basic
building blocks for implementing SLAM approaches, utilizing KALMAN filters, and achieving
sensor fusion by making use of both custom-written and library-based software in ROS and Python.

My Takeaways:

Discovered a deep interest in the hardware and algorithmic strategies used for navigation

Grew significantly more comfortable with Python, both for enabling low-level 
application-specific functionality and as a high-level tool to integrate different factors of a project

Improved approach and techniques for concise and motivating data representation
